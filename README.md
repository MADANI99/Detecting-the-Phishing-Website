By using Deep Learning algorithms to detect whether the website is real or fake
As we all know the deep learning has two types namely supervised and unsupervised learning.
Deep learning techniques are very efficient for natural language and image classification.Here,the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms were used to build the intelligent phishing detection system (IPDS).
